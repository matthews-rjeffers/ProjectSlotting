# Setup Instructions

## First Time Setup

### Option 1: Run Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
.\setup.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

If the setup script fails, follow these steps:

#### 1. Install .NET EF Tools
```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

#### 2. Restore Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd c:\Learning\DEMO
dotnet restore
```

#### 3. Install Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

#### 4. Create Database
```bash
# Create migration
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

# Apply migration and create database
dotnet ef database update
```

## Running the Application

### Option 1: Use Start Script
```bash
.\start.bat
```

### Option 2: Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd c:\Learning\DEMO
dotnet run
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd c:\Learning\DEMO\frontend
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## Initial Setup in Application

Since you mentioned the database doesn't have squads, here's what to do after the app starts:

### 1. Create Your First Squad
1. Click "**Manage Squads**" button in the header
2. Click "**+ Add Squad**"
3. Enter:
   - Squad Name: e.g., "Squad Alpha"
   - Squad Lead Name: e.g., "John Doe"
4. Click "**Create**"

### 2. Add Team Members to Squad
1. In the squad card, click "**Manage Team**"
2. Click "**+ Add Team Member**"
3. Fill in:
   - Name: e.g., "Jane Smith"
   - Role: Select "Squad Lead", "Project Lead", or "Developer"
   - Daily Capacity: e.g., 6.5 (adjust based on individual productivity)
4. Click "**Add**"
5. Repeat for all team members

### 3. Recommended Team Structure
For each squad, create:
- **1 Squad Lead** (role: Squad Lead) - 6.5 hours/day
- **3 Project Leads** (role: Project Lead) - 6.5 hours/day each
- **8 Developers** (role: Developer) - 6.5 hours/day each (adjust per person)

**Total per squad:** 11 members = ~71.5 hours/day capacity

### 4. Individual Capacity Adjustments
You can customize daily capacity for each person:
- High performers: 7-8 hours/day
- Part-time: 4 hours/day
- New team members: 5-6 hours/day
- Standard: 6.5 hours/day

## Troubleshooting

### "No squads yet" message
This is normal on first run. Click "Create First Squad" or "Manage Squads" to add squads.

### npm install errors
Try:
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Database errors
Reset database:
```bash
dotnet ef database drop
dotnet ef database update
```

### Port conflicts
- Backend uses port 5000
- Frontend uses port 3000
Make sure these ports are available.

## Quick Test

After setup:
1. Create a squad with 11 members
2. Create a project with 160 dev hours, CRP date 4 weeks out
3. Allocate project to squad
4. View Gantt chart showing daily allocations (~8 hrs/day)
5. Edit a team member's capacity and see it update

## Key Features Added

## Next Steps

Once you have squads and team members:

2. Allocate projects to squads
3. View capacity utilization in Gantt charts
4. Drag and drop to reschedule
5. Export data as needed

Enjoy your project scheduling system! ðŸš€
